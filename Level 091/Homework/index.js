//what is async await in js?

//async and await in js is used to simplify asynchronous operattions using promises, it makes code more readable and to manage complex asynchronous flows.
//async function allows us to write promise-baesd code as if it were synchronous.Async functions always returns promise. if returned value ain't promise, Javascript'd automatically convert it into resolved promise
//await keyword is used to wait for promise to resolve, this code wait code until promise doen't return result, it also allows us to write more cleaner and readable asynchronous code.
